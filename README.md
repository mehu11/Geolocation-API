# Geolocation-API

Geolocation API Using OpenStreetMap
Overview
This project is a simple demonstration of utilizing the geolocation feature in web applications using the OpenStreetMap platform. It allows users to retrieve their current location and visualize it on a map provided by OpenStreetMap.

Features
Get Location: Users can click a button to retrieve their current location using the browser's geolocation API.
Map Display: The user's location is displayed on a map provided by OpenStreetMap, giving them a visual representation of their geographical coordinates.
Zoom Control: Users can specify the zoom level of the map to adjust the level of detail displayed.
Customizable: The project is designed to be easily customizable and extensible, allowing developers to add additional features as needed.
How It Works
The application utilizes the Geolocation API provided by modern web browsers to retrieve the user's current coordinates.
Once the coordinates are obtained, they are used to generate a URL that links to OpenStreetMap, showing the user's location on a map.
Users can customize the zoom level of the map to adjust the level of detail displayed.
